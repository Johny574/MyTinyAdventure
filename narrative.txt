[Dim cave interior. Rain echoes from above. The player stirs.]

GRUK (softly): You're awake. Good. I thought you'd bleed out like the others.

[He hands the player a damp cloth and a cracked flask.]

GRUK: I dragged you from the battlefield. They saw me. Called me traitor. Banished me.

[He turns away, voice bitter.]

GRUK: I don't regret it. Not yet.

[Pause. The player stands.]

GRUK: If you're smart, you'll leave. If you're foolish... maybe you'll help me fix this mess.

[He tosses a torn map onto the ground.]

GRUK: Your kind and mine? We used to share fire. Now we share graves.
